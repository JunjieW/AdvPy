    "The fundamental nature of Cython can be summed up as follows: **Cython is Python with C data types**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Who uses Cython?\n",
    "\n",
    "Cython is particularly popular among scientific users of Python, where it has \"the perfect audience\" according to Python developer Guido van Rossum.[17] Of particular note:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The free software SageMath computer algebra system depends on Cython, both for performance and to interface with other libraries.\n",
    "- Significant parts of the scientific computing libraries **SciPy, pandas and scikit-learn** are written in Cython.\n",
    "- Some high traffic websites such as **Quora** use Cython.\n",
    "Cython's domain is not limited to just numerical computing. For example, the lxml XML toolkit is written mostly in Cython, and like its predecessor Pyrex, Cython is used to provide Python bindings for many C and C++ libraries like the messaging library ZeroMQ. Cython can also be used to develop parallel programs for multi-core processor machines; this feature makes use of the OpenMP library. (from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cython))\n",
    "\n",
    "## How does it work?\n",
    "Cython is a modification of Python that adds C data types. Almost any piece of Python code is also valid Cython code (with a few [limitations](http://docs.cython.org/src/userguide/limitations.html#cython-limitations).) Cython then converts the (modified) Python code into C code which makes equivalent calls to the Python/C API. This C code is then compiled into a shared library which can be imported into Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Cython, function parameters and variables can be declared to have C data types, and code which manipulates Python values and C values can be freely intermixed. Cython takes care of converting from C to Python data types automatically wherever possible. Reference count maintenance and error checking of Python operations is also automatic, and the full power of Python’s exception handling facilities, including the try-except and try-finally statements, is still available.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of Cython\n",
    "There are two main benefits of Cython:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Speed.** How much performance improves depends very much on the program. Typical Python numerical programs would tend to gain very little as most time is spent in lower-level C anyway. However, for-loop-style programs can improve by many orders of magnitude.\n",
    "2. **Easy calling into C code.** One of Cython’s purposes is to allow easy wrapping of C libraries. When writing code in Cython you can call into C code as easily as into Python code."

A `cpdef` can be called from anywhere, but uses the faster C calling conventions when being called from other Cython code. A `cpdef` can also be overridden by a Python method on a subclass or an instance attribute, even when called from Cython. If this happens, most performance gains are of course lost and even if it does not, there is a tiny overhead in calling a `cpdef` method from Cython compared to calling a `cdef` method.\n",
